/*

vector::resize() - The function alters the containerâ€™s content in actual by inserting 
                   or deleting the elements from it. 
				   
>> It happens so,

=> If the given value of n is less than the size at present then extra elements are 
   demolished. 
=> If n is more than current size of container then upcoming elements are 
   appended at the end of the vector.
   
Syntax: vectorname.resize(int n, int val)
